Hmmm...

The levels will need to all have access to some sort of visual game engine...

This should be able to proccess
    - Sprites in any given location
    - Images in any given location
    
    - The Level will be responsible for handling collisions, etc. 
    - The Level will be responsible for metrics on success, etc.
