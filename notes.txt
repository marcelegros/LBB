Hmmm...

The levels will need to all have access to some sort of visual game engine...

This should be able to proccess
    - Sprites in any given location
    - Images in any given location
    
    - The Level will be responsible for handling collisions, etc. 
    - The Level will be responsible for metrics on success, etc.

    There can be a generic "Level" component, that can be passed objects as children, and bools to turn off certain types of interaction. 

    This level component will require a parent to handle the callbacks that are involved in object collision, click on object, etc. 


    Everything will be rendered on a canvas, so somehow the level needs to be capable of rendering at a certain frame rate onto a canvas. 

    ... I'll make a Screen, that is an element Level. The screen will be able to render everything as needed....
